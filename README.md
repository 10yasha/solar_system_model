# Solar System Model

Implemented with C++17 in Visual Studio 19 using OpenGL library.

This model contains scale-accurate sun/planet/satellite models, an asteroid belt, etc.
Initially wanted to make distances accurate as well, however real astronomical distances are too vast,
making for a boring simulation.

### Execution
The file 'solar_system_model.exe'--compiled for x64 windows OS--can be found under the 'release' directory. 

### Controls
- W/A/S/D or up/down/left/right keys to translate view.
- mouse scroll to move fowards or backwards
- mouse drag to rotate viewing angle
- collapsable user interface to toggle different display and simulation elements
